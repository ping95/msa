- @jamesfitzsimons implemented Pagination support and fixed a couple of MongoDB errors
- #47, #51 Fix issue when objects returned from MongoBackend would strip some properties out
- #28 Added support for X-TAXII Custom Headers
- Added new Docker & Docker Compose configuration:
- Uses mongo image, mongo-express (lightweight web administrative interface for mongoDB) and the medallion build which is slightly tweaked
- The following bugs were fixed:
- The MemoryBackend was manipulating its manifest data. When using match[version] against a manifest resource with multiple versions available. It would get modified permanently
- Removed MongoBackend $project in pipelines that would cause loss of properties or custom properties
- Errors produced by the TAXII Server now return JSON that align with Section 3.6 of the spec
- Simplified some of the code for checking permission or determining if a collection exists
- The rest are code quality changes and consistency
